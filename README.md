## Overview

OpTrade leverages state-of-the-art deep learning and machine learning models for time series forecasting in options markets. The project has two main objectives:

1. **Alpha Generation**: Discovering and forecasting alpha term structures to analyze market dynamics across various options contracts
2. **Trading Strategy Development**: Translating these insights into actionable trading signals (planned for future implementation)

Currently, the project is focused on completing the microstructure analysis framework.

## What is an Alpha Term Structure?

An alpha term structure represents how excess returns (alpha) are expected to evolve over different time horizons. It is defined as:

$$
\mathbf{r} = (r_1, r_2, \dots, r_H)^T
$$

Where:
- $r_t$ is the expected excess return of an option contract at time $t$
- The vector captures returns across multiple future time points

This structure helps traders:
- Determine optimal entry/exit points
- Develop time-specific trading strategies
- Manage risk (e.g., adjust positions) 
- Select appropriate option expiration dates

## Documentation
This project includes extensive documentation that is essential for understanding the framework. Users are strongly encouraged to review these documents before usage.
